According to the official documentation, Python 3.13 was released on October 7, 2024.
Here are some key highlights of this new release:

## A more user-friendly interactive interpreter
* The prompts and error messages now come with color by default, making it easier to read and understand.
* You can edit multiple lines of code with the ability to preserve command history.
* There's a “Paste mode” (activated by pressing F3), which simplifies pasting larger chunks of code. Press F3 again to switch back to the regular prompt.

## Clearer error messages
* By default, error messages (tracebacks) are now shown in color when displayed in the terminal, making it easier to spot issues.
* If you accidentally name your script the same as a standard Python library module, it can cause confusion. Now, when that happens, the error message will suggest a solution:
<div class="code-container" style="overflow-x: auto;">
  <pre><code class="language-python">
$ python random.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/me/random.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    <span style="color: red;">import random</span>
  File "/home/me/random.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(random.randint(5))
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: module 'random' has no attribute 'randint' (consider renaming '/home/me/random.py' since it has the same name as the standard library module named 'random' and the import system gives it precedence)
  </code></pre>
</div>

## Free-threaded CPython
CPython now offers experimental support for running in "free-threaded" mode, where the global interpreter lock (GIL) is turned off. 
This allows Python to fully use the processing power of your system by running threads in parallel across multiple CPU cores. While not all programs will automatically benefit from this, those that are designed to use threading can run faster on multi-core systems. **Note: Free-threaded mode is still experimental**, so expect some bugs and slower performance when running single-threaded tasks.

## Experimental Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler
If you configure CPython using the --enable-experimental-jit option, you can enable a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that may improve the speed of some Python programs.

## And much more... :)
